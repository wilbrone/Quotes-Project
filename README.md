Depending on the number of votes the cards where the quotes are displayed changes to color yellow background when the like votes/upvotes are either 5 or greater  than 5.
The users are also able to delete a quote or even add a quote they like or the ones they come up with. the quote will be added to the list of quotes and other people will be able to view and read it and give it a like or dislike vote.
